 If you work in an offline environment or repeatedly see this error, try downloading a version of the extension with all the dependencies pre-included from https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/releases, then use the "Install from VSIX" command in VS Code to install it.  
##### 一看到这个错误我就感觉到事情不妙，因为我的网络没问题，梯子随便上，这还提示我网络原因，多半是网络代理出事了，解决办法可以很简单，自动忽视网络代理问题，直接采用VSCode提供的解决办法，离线安装VSIX。
##### 首先在<https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/releases>上下载c++ extension，打开VScode，点击extension，在属性框右上角找到“Install form VSIX”**

##### 再选中下载好的VSIX包即可安装，之后重启VSCode完事
